# obj-to-fbx
Blender 2.93.1. Add-on that can help you convert multiple objs to a single fbx with multiple sub-components. I modified the batch wavefront import add-on 'p2or' wrote so that it removes the default cube, camera and light and sets the model at the world origin ready to be exported as fbx. Surprisingly, Blender does not natively support multiple obj import so I had to build on the existing add-on. (Even if you select multiple files and click the import button, only one file will be imported.) The models I had to work with came with an offset, and it was not located at (0,0,0) although it was not located at the center, so what set_origin function fixes that.
